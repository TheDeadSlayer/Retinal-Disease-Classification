# Retinal Disease Classification
This project focuses on the classification of retinal diseases using images from the [Retinal Disease Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/retinal-disease-classification). The project applies computer vision and deep learning techniques to classify retinal images into distinct categories of diseases. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification, aiming to assist in early detection and diagnosis of retinal disorders.

# Features:
- Dataset: Includes labeled retinal images for various diseases, enabling supervised learning.
- Image Preprocessing: Resized images for uniformity, normalization for consistent pixel intensity scaling.
- Model Architecture: Used a convolutional neural network (CNN) with layers for feature extraction and classification.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure robust performance.
- Potential Applications: Designed to aid ophthalmologists in identifying retinal diseases and enhancing diagnostic workflows.
